        <p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Why? You don't vote for kings. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! We want a shrubbery!! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
          Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! What do you mean? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! He hasn't got shit all over him. A newt?
          <br>
          <br> 
          Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! It's only a model. Well, I got better.
          A newt? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. He hasn't got shit all over him. We want a shrubbery!!
          I am your king. Well, I got better. Did you dress her up like this? Well, we did do the nose. I dunno. Must be a king.
